# PCB-Design
I started designing PCBs after attending a course titled "Design with KiCAD" (By William Santos) on Udemy. This repository contains source files for the open-source projects I have designed along with other finished PCBs I have built.

#
3D model of a Motor Controller board for DC and stepper motors based on the L298 driver module. It can drive two 3-30V DC motors and is capable of 2A continuous current per channel.
