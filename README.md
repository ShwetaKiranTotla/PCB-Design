# PCB-Design
I had attended a course "Design with KiCAD" (By Wissam Botros) on Udemy from which I learnt the know-hows of PCB Design. This repository contains source files for the open-source projects I have designed along with other finished PCBs I have built.

#
3D model of a Motor Controller board for DC and stepper motors based on the L298 driver module. It can drive two 3-30V DC motors and is capable of 2A continuous current per channel.
